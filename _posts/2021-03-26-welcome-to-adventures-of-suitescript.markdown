Hello!

My name is Ryan, I'm a full time software developer that mainly uses PHP and Type/SuiteScript.

This blog is intended for me to share my successes (and frustrations) around developing within NetSuite - especially since the NetSuite developer community isn't exactly known for sharing what they're up to and what they've accomplished within NetSuite/SuiteScript.

Any posts I write will likely be referring to TypeScript snippets since the stack we use involves using Head In The Cloud's NetSuite packages - typings and uploader.

The main goals around this blog are to:

* Spread awareness about the NetSuite development community

* Pass on knowledge to other NetSuite developers

* Have fun and learn something

Ryan
